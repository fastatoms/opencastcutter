MP4 can support multiple video and multiple audio streams.
One way is to copy the different streams into one file by ffmpeg

ffmpeg -i test0.mp4 -i test1.mp4 -map 0:0 -map 0:1 -map 1:0 -c:v copy -c:a copy out.mp4

This command will use test0.mp4 AND test1.mp4 as input files.

Mapping:
the order of the -map commands decides the order of the streams in the output file
-map 0:0  (refers to stream 0 in input file 0. Here, it is video)
-map 0:1  (refers to stream 1 in input file 0. Here, it is audio)
-map 1:0  (refers to stream 1 in input file 1. Here it is the second video stream)


-c:v copy selects copy as the video codec for all video streams
-c:a copy selects copy as the audio codec for all audio streams
